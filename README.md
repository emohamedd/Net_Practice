## Introduction to Networking

Networking is the foundation of modern communication, enabling the exchange of data and information between devices, whether they are located across the room or across the world. Understanding networking fundamentals is essential for anyone in the field of information technology. This README provides an overview of the NetPractice 42 project, a platform designed to help users develop and enhance their networking skills.

## General Networking Concepts

Before diving into the specifics of the NetPractice 42 project, let's briefly explore some fundamental networking concepts:

- **Addressing**:
    - *Definition*: Networking addressing involves uniquely identifying devices within a network. This is achieved by assigning each device a unique address, allowing data to be sent accurately to the intended destination.

- **Subnetting**:
    - *Definition*: Subnetting is a technique used to divide a larger network into smaller, more manageable segments or subnetworks. This optimizes network performance and organization.

- **Routing Table**:
    - *Definition*: A routing table is a data table stored in a router or network device that lists available routes to different network destinations. It determines the path data packets should take within the network.

- **Switch**:
    - *Definition*: A switch operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It connects devices within a local area network (LAN) and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.

- **Router**:
    - *Definition*: A router operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. It connects different networks and directs data between them based on IP addresses.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
    - *Definition*: TCP is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol suite. It ensures reliable and error-checked communication by establishing and managing connections and handling data retransmission when needed.

- **IP (Internet Protocol)**:
    - *Definition*: IP is the primary protocol for routing data packets across networks. It assigns unique IP addresses to devices and determines how data packets are routed.

- **Ranges** (IP Address Ranges):
    - *Definition*: IP address ranges specify sets of IP addresses within a subnet. They are used for purposes like DHCP assignments or firewall rules.

- **Mask** (Subnet Mask):
    - *Definition*: A subnet mask separates the network portion of an IP address from the host portion. It identifies which part of an IP address is for network identification and which is for devices within the network.

- **Base of 2**:
    - *Definition*: The base of 2 table is a table that lists the values of each bit in a binary number. This table is used to calculate subnet masks and IP address ranges. To calculate the subnet mask or IP address range, you start with the highest value in the table that is less than or equal to the desired value, and then add up the values of all the bits up to that point. For example, to calculate a subnet mask for a network with 8 hosts, you would start with the value 128 in the base of 2 table, and then add up the values of all the bits up to that point (128 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 128). This gives you a subnet mask of 255.255.255.128, which allows for 2 subnets and 126 hosts per subnet.
